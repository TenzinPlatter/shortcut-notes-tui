# TODO

- [x] notes system
- [x] move cache out of ~/.config
- [x] add borders between list items (this requires rewriting the List widget)
- [x] implement tmux session management tied to ticket
- [x] add git worktree integration (will use a fzf process over all dirs in Repositories that have a .git dir (or maybe package.xml if i want to search by package?) and then create a worktree for it)
- [x] Refactor msgs/cmds to not take entire Story/Iteration objects, just what is needed to avoid cloning everything
- [ ] Handle multiple active iterations
- [x] Move active_story out of story list state into data state
- [ ] Add (fuzzy?) search functionality to action_menu, and numbers? Could be like code actions
- [ ] Move action menu to use custom list
- [ ] Keybind to open ticket in browser
- [ ] Fix active story not saving properly
- [ ] Make fzf for git worktree cancellable without crashing
- [ ] Ask task queue with notifications for async tasks like api fetching etc. should be able to display multiple tasks at once
- add shortcut integration:
  - [x] Edit ticket description
  - [ ] Edit ticket comments
  - [ ] attach note as file to ticket
  - [ ] Change ticket state
  - [ ] Update days taken (do automatically when putting ticket to finished?)
  - [ ] TODO: add todo points for epic/iteration integration
